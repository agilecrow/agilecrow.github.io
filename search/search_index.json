Good question. Here are a few scenarios you might find familiar, and an idea of what you can expect from us: Analysis paralysis Product requirements are flooding in from all directions, and you're under pressure to get stuff done. But what should be done first? Agile Crow will work with your business stakeholders to understand which requirements are of highest value, then help you refine, split and prioritise into Product Backlog Items. If you like, we'll also give you a few tips on how to more effectively manage requirements gathering and refinement in the future. The Bottleneck Everything used to work fine, but now it seems to take ages to get anything done, even though you're working harder than ever. We will work with your teams to understand where their painpoints are. We'll then suggest ways to make your development process more efficient (and less stressful for everyone). Scaling challenges Great! It's full speed ahead, and now your development team needs extra members. You've started hiring developers, but you're not really sure how they'll fit into your existing team structure. Oh, and they're based in a different country. At Agile Crow, we know how to scale development teams. We'll look at your current team structure and understand the best way for new developers to join and get up to speed smoothly. We'll also help you manage team size and composition to maximise efficiency - even when working across multiple geographical locations. Big Bang release woes You started the year with a clear idea of what you needed to deliver, but after reaching Version_32_Final_FINAL_v8 of your product roadmap, that's somehow got lost along the way. Your stakeholders are wondering where all those features have got to, and you're nervous about the next gigantic release. We know that tight feedback loops are critical to keep up with shifting business requirements. Agile Crow will take a look at your current development lifecycle, and provide advice on how you can reduce your lead times, incorporate stakeholder feedback sooner, and start delivering value more frequently. We're also not afraid to pitch in where we can, when you're up against a deadline. Something a bit different? Hopefully the above examples have given you a flavour of what we're up to. Of course, no two situations are quite alike - so feel free to drop us a line for a chat about how we can help you.","title":"Services"},{"location":"services/#so-what-do-you-actually-do","text":"Good question.
